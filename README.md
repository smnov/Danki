        # Installation

## Backend
Let's setup our python backend.
```    
> cd backend-api
```
First you need to create your python virtual environment:
```
> python3 -m venv venv
```
You can use any virtual environment, but here I use venv.
Activate virtual environment:
```
> source venv/bin/activate
```
Then you need to install requierments for our shop:
```
> pip install -r requierements.txt
```
Now you can run django server
```
> python3 manage.py runserver
```
That's it for our backend.
## Frontend
Go to frontend directory:
```
> cd ../frontend
```
Install dependences:
```
> npm install
```
Run frontend server:
```
> npm start
```
Now if you go to http://localhost:3000 you will see the main page.
